# OrderAndStorageManagementSystem
## Manefisto
The repository *OrderAndStorageManagementSystem* is created to maintain the project of the same name, which was created for the Homework 1 to 5 of the course Windows Programming enrolled during the 2019 Fall Semester at the National Taipei University of Technology. The repository is also served as my reference for **MVC Pattern**, **Observer Pattern** and **Unit Testing**.
